# Encounter-Generator
My mini app I want to turn into a full-fledged Encounter Generator (both monsters and skill encounters) for Pathfinder and other table top gaming systems. Some of the categories for generating content will not be a 1-1 match with all system, but they should provide enough content for the person running the game to convert the information into their specific system's ruleset.

At this time, the index page is where the final results of development will be placed. The monster and skill pages are where I am working on creating the design and logic of the generators.

# TODO
- get baseline stats per lvl of monster
